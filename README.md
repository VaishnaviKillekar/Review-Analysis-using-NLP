# review_analysis

This is a Machine Learning Model which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to examine the reviews. 
Reviews can be for any product or service.
The reviews are split into words and stemmed to their root word using Porter Stemming Algorithm.
A bag of words model is created and the topmost important words are retained.
A dataset of 1000 reviews has been provided and it's in a .tsv (tab separated valuess) format.
The model's accuracy and precision improves if it is trained with a bigger dataset.
The model is trained Naive Bayes Classifier to differentiate between positive and negative reviews.
